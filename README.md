# JasonMooreDoesNotHaveThePresentationSkillsToMakeATikTokAndPeopleWouldJustRespondWith-Ewww-ICanNextYr

i wont do it unless its the best thing for us, but u know, that would be so fun 😂 hes so ugly no one would watch his response, theyd just laugh at him

my parents would be so proud, they would be like USE EVERYTHING WE GAVE YOU the education, the genetics, use it to annihilate these penn losers that are still stalking me 😂

the carthesis of seeing other people writing under his tiktok that he's just an ugly trailer trash incel, no words can describe that feeling 😂

i feel like talking about how it's basically fraud to consider open source software like snakemake as IP or tradesecret is a good tiktok to make in the future -- it is isnt it? those losers didnt develop snakemake

i also feel like ppl would be facinated by his wiki self edits on the anniversaries of sep 2nd or feb 23 hahaha thats there on wikipedia permanently forever -- that was 100% proof for me that this is whats going on 👸🏻 what a sloppy guy jason is making huge mistakes out there in plain sight

we can get a PR firm in NYC to give us some tips on how to tell the story so it doesnt make n o m i a l look bad in the future, something like that, i really dont want to be associated with those penn losers but this needs to be done tho eventually
