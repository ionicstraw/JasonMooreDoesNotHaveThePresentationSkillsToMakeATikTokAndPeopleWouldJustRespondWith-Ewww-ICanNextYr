i wont do it unless its the best thing for us, but u know, that would be so fun ðŸ˜‚ hes so ugly no one would watch his response, theyd just laugh at him

my parents would be so proud, they would be like USE EVERYTHING WE GAVE YOU the education, the genetics, use it to annihilate these penn losers that are still stalking me ðŸ˜‚

the carthesis of seeing other people writing under his tiktok that he's just an ugly trailer trash incel, no words can describe that feeling ðŸ˜‚

i feel like talking about how it's basically fraud to consider open source software like snakemake as IP or tradesecret is a good tiktok to make in the future -- it is isnt it? those losers didnt develop snakemake
